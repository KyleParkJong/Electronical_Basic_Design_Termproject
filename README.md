# 0. Topic of our Team : __Smart Doorlock applying OTP__
>  * _Smart_ : Person detection using AI (TensorflowLite)
>  * _OTP (One-Time-Password)_ : Change to new password every 30 seconds
>  * Worked in groups of three

## > Evalutation Criteria
* Creativity
* Number of modules used, AI used

## > Things provided in class
* Arduino Nano 33 BLE, ArduCam
* Person detection TensorflowLite training model 

# 1. Programming language & SW tools & HW used
* Arduino programming (C programming)
* Arduino IDE, Colab Tensorflow
* Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano 33 BLE, ArduCam

# 2. Our design

> A, B, C boards are Arduino Nano 33 BLE, all connected through physical wire.

> Three boards were used to perform different functions independently.

* __B board__
    + Generates a new password every 30 seconds and transmits it to an application on a smart phone produced by App Inventor through Bluetooth.
    + Input received by 4x4 matrix and status displayed via LCD display
    + Send signals to A board

* __A board__
    + ArduCam is attached and it detects human using "Person Detection" TensorflowLite model
    + Shows current state through LEDs (Blue : human detected, Red : password wrong, Green : password correct)
    + Send signals to B board and C board

* __C board__
    + Controls servo motor, ultrasonic sensor and buzzer through signal from A board

# 3. Source code

## A board 
* Person_detection_change.ino, Arduino_detection_responder.cpp
    + Coded based on reference code given from class 

## B board
* B_board_bluetooth.ino
    + Coded everything a-to-z

## C board
* C_board.ino
    + Coded everything a-to-z

# 4. Result

## Password correct (front)

## Door locked (back)

<img src="/images/4.jpeg" width="60%" height="60%" title="ldpcd_result" alt="ldpcd_result"></img>

* Can see servo motor blocking the door

## Door opened (back)

<img src="/images/3.jpeg" width="60%" height="60%" title="ldpcd_result" alt="ldpcd_result"></img>

* When the door is closed again with the door open, the motor automatically operates and locks the door by recognizing that the door is closed through an ultrasonic sensor.

## Checking password with a mobile phone application through Bluetooth.

# 6. What I learned
* Arduino programming (C)
    + Basic of Arduino
    + Interrupt timing, Bluetooth
    + Other modules (Ultrasonic sensor,4x4 matrix, ArduCam, buzzer, servo, LCD display, 7 segments)
* Applied Tensorflow Lite AI model into Arduino
* Learned how to collaborate successfully and efficiently with team-mates
